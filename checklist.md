This is the checklist until publication:

DONE
Technical:
1. Gym environment simulator
2. Backend functions to make the vpa recommender emulator
3. Kubernetes baseline simulator
4. Parsing of the arabesque data
5. Partially parsing of the alibaba dataset
6. Stress generator based-on the dataset


TODO
Theoretical:
1. Writing the exact outcome of the paper all the charts
2. Ideally find a justification for why we think RL would result in better situation
3. The stress generator with stop/start
Technical:
1. Implementation of the emulator
    1. Use the backend for making the create/recreate functionality of the VPA
    2. Some monitoring for the resource usage grafana/prometheous
    3. integration of the new stress generator
4. Desiging reward function based-on the methodology
5. Implementation of the SHOWER baseline method
6. Parsing of the Alibaba dataset
